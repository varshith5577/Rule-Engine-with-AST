# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

This project implements a simple rule engine that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate rules based on user-defined conditions. It supports various logical and comparison operators and can evaluate rules against user data.

## Features

- **Operators Supported**: Supports logical operators (`AND`, `OR`) and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`).
- **Rule Parsing**: Parses rule strings and constructs an AST.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluates the AST against user data to determine if the rules are met.
- **Combining Rules**: Allows combining multiple rules into a single AST.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.6 or higher. You can clone the repository and run the script directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varshith5577/Rule Engine with AST.git
cd rule_engine_ast
